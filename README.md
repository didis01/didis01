Hi! My name is Diego, but I like to call me **Didis**. I'm from Spain.

I'm a student of 4th of ESO (10th grade on US) interested in code and robotics, I also enjoy watching anime and memes. I began in this world when I went to my first robotics competition. Then I started playing with **Arduino** and **C++**.
Currently i'm learning python for A.I purposes. :)
